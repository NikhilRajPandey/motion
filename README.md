# motion
To Solve Motion 9th Class Problems

<h1>What this program done</h1>
We have given 3 equation of motion

(v: Final Velcoity, u: Initial Velocity,a:accelaration,t:time,s:Distance)

v = u + at (I equation)
s = ut + a*t*t*1/2 (II equation)
2as = (v*v) - (u*u) (III equation)

We have to find a certain using this equation
Example:
If Time was not given but we gave to find s then we have to use III equation

All the args of function that are given to you in  are SI UNIT

<h1>Example</h1>
Suppose You want to find acceleration then you can write like this:

Motion.fromGiven('a',u=5,t=2,v=10)
It will result 2
Similiary This program will help you so much in physics
